<h3>Configuring Roles, Departments, & Teams</h3>

<p>
  
<ul>
  <li><b>Note</b>: There are two panels when navigating osTicket; <b>Agent Panel</b> and <b>Admin Panel</b>, you'll know which panel you are on if the <b>opposite panel</b> is displayed on the top right of the UI next to your user login name</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this example, the user "josh" is on the Agent Panel</li>
    <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/9a308358-cdae-4274-a1a6-b77f334f0550">
</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Roles</b> grant certain permisions to Agents in an Department they are assigned to</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, go to the <b>Agents</b> tab and click on <b>Roles</b>, then click on <b>Add New Role</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Note</b>: osTickets creates four Roles (All Access, Expanded Access, Limited Access, and View Only) by default.</li>
      <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/1db2da4f-978b-48b1-8f09-36698ed94ec6"></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Name the new Role <b>Supreme Admin</b>, and click on the <b>Permissions</b> tab; in this tab you can assign specific permissions to this role. For our "Supreme Admin" Role, we will check every box under the <b>Tickets</b>, <b>Tasks</b>, and <b>Knowledgebase</b> tabs. Click on <b>Add Role</b> to finish and create the role.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/499aa546-4948-4e50-afeb-1c809c8f8ac7"></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <li><b>Departments</b> are needed to route and resolve tickets based on their importance or instructions</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Still on the Agents tab, click on <b>Departments</b> and click on <b>Add New Department</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Note</b>: Much like Roles, osTicket also creates two Departments (Maintenance and Support) by default</li>
    <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/3785fdb6-b7ff-4d09-a9c2-9605bf4e6a7d"></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Name the Department <b>System Administrators</b> (we'll leave everything else by default for now), then click on <b>Create Dept</b> to create Department</li>
  <ul>
    
  </ul>
  </ul>

  <li><b>Teams</b> allow us to organize Agents from different Departments in osTicket to handle specific issues and supersede Agents and their Departments' parameter rules</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Agents tab, click on <b>Teams</b> and click on <b>Add New Team</b></li>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Note</b>: Just like previous set ups, osTicket creates a Team (Level I Support) by default</li>
    <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/e2b093c8-e4b7-40c5-9dde-60b0fb2bcf50"></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Name the Team <b>Level II Support</b> then click on <b>Create Team</b> to create the Team</li>
    <ul>
      <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/589f3244-1bab-4119-ba25-a23f8026e65c"></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
</ul>
  
</p>

</br>

<h3>Allowing anyone to create Tickets</h3>

<p>
  
<ul>
  <li>In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, head to the <b>Settings</b> tab and click on <b>Users</b>, make sure <b>Registration Required</b> is unchecked. This will allow us to create tickets anonymously</li>
  <ul>
    <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/b674af79-ad6a-4f42-8479-27fc61d0de65"></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  
</p>

</br>

<h3>Adding Agents and Users</h3>

<p>
  
<ul>
  <li><b>Agents</b> (or Workers) are given the access to the help desk in osTicket to respond, resolve, and update the status of tickets</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li>In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, head to the <b>Agents</b> tab and click on <b>Add New Agent</b></li>
    <ul>
      
  <li>For this tutorial, we will be creating two new Agents <b>Jane</b> and <b>John</b>, it is advise to have a notepad ready to catalog login information as you enter their credentials, but we will set their user names as <b>[name].doe</b> and both of their passwords as <b>Password1</b> for convenience (which is our admin password from the installation tutorial)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill in the Agent's basic info and set the Agent's email address as <b>[name].doe@osticket.com</b> and click on <b>Set Password</b></li>
      <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/73e177f0-59b2-445e-946d-7ba8e316fc65"></li>
      <li>Set the Agent's password to <b>Password1</b> and unchecked the boxes to prevent the Agent for our example from needing to reset password or change password after login</li>
     
  </ul>
    <li>Go the <b>Access</b> tab to set the Agent's <b>Primary Department</b> (Mandatory to create the Agent). <b>Extended Access</b> can also be added to the Agent in order to access additional Departments</li>
    <ul>
    <li><img width="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/b145aaa3-5171-43c7-bd97-815aeb658a4e"></li>
    </ul>
    <li>OPTIONAL: Head to the <b>Teams</b> tab to assign the Agent to a Team</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li><b>Users</b> (or Customers) are creators and owners of tickets and by using osTicket they are able to track the status of their tickets</li>
  
  <ul>
    <li>In the <b>Agent Panel</b>, go to the <b>Users</b> tab and click on <b>Add User</b></li>
    <ul>
      
  </ul>
    <li>For this tutorial, we will be creating two new Users <b>Ken</b> and <b>Karen</b> and setting up usernames, emails, and passwords similar to our Agents.</li>
    <ul>
      
  </ul>
</ul>
  
</ul>
  
</p>

</br>

<h3>Adding SLA Plans</h3>

<p>
  
<ul>
  <li><b>Service Level Agreements</b> or SLA Plans provide a length of time for the ticket Administrator when the ticket is expected be CLOSED. They can also be designated to specific Departments or Help Topics</li>
  <li>In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, go to the <b>Manage</b> tab and drop down to <b>SLA</b> then click on <b>Add New SLA Plan</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><img width="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/d3c4281b-6ee2-48fd-8ea3-2f202d035ea9"></li>
    <li><img width="741" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/3bfdf117-f701-45c8-b1e8-0220ee51bc73"></li>
  </ul>
  <li>osTicket by default has the SLA Plan <b>Default SLA</b>. We will be creating three SLA Plans each with their own length of time for different kinds of importance of the ticket, from highest priority to lowest priority:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>SEV-A with <b>1 hour Grace Period, 24/7 Schedule</b>, suitable for tickets that are business critical</li>
    <li>SEV-B with <b>4 hour Grace Period, 24/7 Schedule</b>, suitable for tickets affecting employees such as troubleshooting or PC problems</li>
    <li>SEV-C with <b>8 hour Grace Period, business hours Schedule</b>, suitable for tickets requesting new equipment</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Example of creating SEV-A SLA Plan, click on <b>Add Plan</b> to create the SLA Plan</li>
  <ul>
    <li><img width="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/36326a5b-7a04-4c58-b893-cb7500da6a31"></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  
</p>

</br>

<h3>Configuring Help Topics</h3>

<p>
  
<ul>
  <li><b>Help Topics</b> are helpful to streamline the ticket entry experience for the user by helping them specify their ticket info and also determine what Department the ticket should go to</li>
  <li>In the <b>Admin Panel</b>, go to the <b>Manage</b> tab and click on <b>Add New Help Topic</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Note</b>: osTicket creates four Help Topics (Feedback, General Inquiry, Report a Problem, and Report a Problem / Access Issue) by default</li>
    <li><img width="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/c46b9ea4-1081-4dd6-9df2-55f593be6894"></li>
  </ul>
  <li>We will create four different Help Topics based on the potential serverity a ticket could have, from highest to lowest priority:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Business Critical Outage</li>
    <li>Personal Computer Issues </li>
    <li>Equipment Request</li>
    <li>Password Reset</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Example of entering credentials for the Help Topic "Equipment Request," click on <b>Add Topic</b> to create the Help Topic</li>
  <ul>
    <li><img width="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/antxcyber/post-install-config/assets/148983947/8652d732-69cd-4a10-a8a6-fbd8680cd04d"></li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>
  
</p>
